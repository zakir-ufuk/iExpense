In this project I am going to build iExpense, which is an expense tracker that separates personal costs from business costs. At its core this is an app with a form (how much did you spend?) and a list (here are the amounts you spent),  in order to accomplish those two things I am going to use: 
* Present and dismiss a second screen of data (@Observable)
* Delete rows from a list (onDelete())
* Save and load user data (UserDefaults)
